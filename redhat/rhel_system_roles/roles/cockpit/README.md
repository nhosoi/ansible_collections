# Cockpit
![CI Testing](https://github.com/redhat.rhel_system_roles.cockpit/workflows/tox/badge.svg)

Installs and configures the Cockpit Web Console for distributions that support it, such as RHEL, Fedora, and a few others.

## Requirements

  - RHEL/CentOS 7.x depend on the Extras repository being enabled.
  - Recommended to use linux-system-roles.firewall to make the Web Console available remotely.

## Role Variables

Available variables per distribution are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

The primary variable is `cockpit_packages` which allows you to specify your own selection of cockpit packages you want to install, or allows you to choose one of three predefined package sets: `default, minimal, or full`.  Obviously `default` is selected if you do not define this variable.  Not that the packages installed may vary depending on the distribution and version as different packages of cockpit functionality have been provided over time.  Also, some may not be available on all distributions, such as `cockpit-docker` which was deprecated on RHEL in favor of `cockpit-podman`.

Example of explicit cockpit packages to install.  Dependencies should pull in the minimal cockpit packages so that they work.
```yaml
cockpit_packages:
  - cockpit-storaged
  - cockpit-podman
```
Example of using the predefined package sets.  This is the recommended method for installation.
```yaml
cockpit_packages: default
    # equivalent to
    #  - cockpit
    #  - cockpit-networkmanager
    #  - cockpit-packagekit
    #  - cockpit-selinux
    #  - cockpit-storaged

cockpit_packages: minimal
    # equivalent to
    #  - cockpit-system
    #  - cockpit-ws

cockpit_packages: full
    # equivalent to globbing all of them
    #  - cockpit-*
    # This is will pull in many packages such as
        #  - cockpit		## Default list
        #  - cockpit-bridge
        #  - cockpit-networkmanager
        #  - cockpit-packagekit
        #  - cockpit-selinux
        #  - cockpit-storaged
        #  - cockpit-system
        #  - cockpit-ws
        ## and all the rest
        #  - cockpit-389-ds
        #  - cockpit-composer
        #  - cockpit-dashboard
        #  - cockpit-doc
        #  - cockpit-docker
        #  - cockpit-kdump
        #  - cockpit-machines
        #  - cockpit-ostree
        #  - cockpit-pcp
        #  - cockpit-podman
        #  - cockpit-session-recording
        #  - cockpit-sosreport
        #  - cockpit-tests
```

## Example Playbooks
The most simple example.
```yaml
---
- hosts: fedora, rhel7, rhel8
  become: yes
  roles:
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.cockpit
```
Another example, including the role as a task to control when the action is performed.  It is also recommended to configure the firewall using the linux-system-roles.firewall role to make the service accessible.
```yaml
---
tasks:  
  - name: Install RHEL/Fedora Web Console (Cockpit)
    include_role:
      name: redhat.rhel_system_roles.cockpit
    vars:
      cockpit_packages: default
      #cockpit_packages: minimal
      #cockpit_packages: full

  - name: Configure Firewall for Web Console
    include_role:
      name: linux-system-roles.firewall
    vars:
      firewall:
        service: cockpit
        state: enabled
```
